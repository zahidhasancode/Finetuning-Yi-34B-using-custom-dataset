# Finetuning-Yi-34B-using-custom-dataset


## Setup and Preliminaries

### GPU Status Check

Command: !nvidia-smi
## Purpose: To verify the availability and status of an NVIDIA GPU, which is crucial for GPU-accelerated machine learning tasks.

Subsequent Steps (Hypothetical Structure)

### Environment Setup

Commands to install necessary libraries and dependencies, configure the environment, and ensure compatibility with the hardware.

### Data Preparation

Code snippets related to data loading, preprocessing, and possibly augmenting datasets to fit the requirements of the model.
### Model Configuration

Setting up model parameters, including architecture choices, hyperparameters, and training options.

### Training

Executing the training process, involving feeding data into the model, adjusting weights through backpropagation, and monitoring performance metrics.

### Evaluation and Testing

Assessing the model's performance on a separate test set to evaluate its generalization capabilities.
## Inference/Demo

Demonstrating the model's application, possibly through a simple chat interface or by processing predefined inputs.

## Conclusion
This markdown documentation provides an organized framework for understanding and navigating the notebook. For detailed implementation and code comments, further analysis of each code snippet would be required to tailor the documentation to the specific operations and functionalities implemented within the notebook.
